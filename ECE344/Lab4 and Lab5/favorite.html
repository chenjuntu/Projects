<h2>Lab 4: A Multi-Threaded Web Server</h2>

<h4>Due Date: Nov 9, 2015, 5 pm</h4>

<p>In this lab, you will be developing a multi-threaded web server, and
  evaluating its performance. To simplify the project, we are providing you with
  the code for a very basic web server. This basic web server operates with only
  a single thread. It will be your job to make the web server multi-threaded so
  that it is more efficient.</p>

<h2>HTTP Background</h2> 

<p>In this section, we provide a brief overview of how a simple web server
  works and the HTTP protocol. Our goal in providing you with a basic web server
  is that you should be shielded from all of the details of network connections
  and the HTTP protocol. The code that we give you already handles everything
  that we describe in this section. If you are really interested in the full
  details of the HTTP protocol, you can read
  the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">HTTP
    specification</a>, but we do not recommend it for this project.</p>

<p>Most web browsers and web servers interact using a text-based protocol
  called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A web browser opens an Internet
  connection to a web server and requests some content with HTTP. The web server
  responds with the requested content and closes the connection. The browser
  reads the content and displays it on the screen.</p> 

<p>Each piece of content on the server is associated with a file. If a client
  requests a specific disk file, then this is referred to as static content. If
  a client requests an executable file to be run and its output returned, then
  this is called dynamic content. In this lab, our web server will only handle
  static content.</p>

<p>Each file requested from the server has a unique name known as a URL
  (Universal Resource Locator). For example, the
  URL <tt>http://www.eecg.toronto.edu:80/Welcome.html</tt> identifies an HTML
  file called “index.html” on Internet host
  “www.eecg.toronto.edu” that is managed by a web server listening
  on port 80. The port number is optional and defaults to the well-known HTTP
  port of 80.</p>

<!--
<p>URLs for executable files can include program arguments after the file
  name. A &ldquo;?&rdquo; character separates the file name from the arguments
  and each argument is separated by a &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; character. This string
  of arguments will be passed to a CGI program as part of its
  &ldquo;QUERY_STRING&rdquo; environment variable.</p>
-->

<p>An HTTP request (from the web browser to the server) consists of a request
  line, followed by zero or more request header lines, and finally an empty text
  line. A request line has the form: <tt>method uri
  version</tt>. The <tt>method</tt> is usually GET (but may be other things,
  such as POST, OPTIONS, or PUT). The <tt>uri</tt> is the file name and any
  optional arguments (for dynamic content). The <tt>version</tt> indicates the
  version of the HTTP protocol that the web client is using (e.g., HTTP/1.0 or
  HTTP/1.1). The request headers define various parameters of the request such
  as the type of browser (user agent) making the request. Each header is a
  colon-separated name-value pair in clear-text string format. The request line
  and other header fields must each end with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; (that is, a
  carriage return character followed by a line feed character). The empty line
  must consist of only &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.</p>

<p>An HTTP response (from the server to the browser) is similar; it consists of
  a response line, zero or more response header lines, an empty text line, and
  finally the interesting part, the response body. A response line has the
  form <tt>version status message</tt>. The <tt>status</tt> is a three-digit
  positive integer that indicates the state of the request; some common states
  and the corresponding messages are 200 for <b>OK</b>, 403
  for <b>Forbidden</b>, and 404 for <b>Not found</b>. Two important lines in the
  response header are <b>Content-Type</b>, which tells the client the MIME type
  of the content in the response body (e.g., html or gif)
  and <b>Content-Length</b>, which indicates the size of the response body in
  bytes. The server can add any custom header line.</p>

<p>Again, you don't need to know this information about HTTP unless you want
  to understand the details of the code we have given you. <b>You will not need
    to modify any of the procedures in the web server that deal with the HTTP
    protocol or network connections.</b></p> 

<h2>Setup</h2> 

<p>Add the source files for this lab, available in <tt>webserver.tar</tt>, to
  your repository, and run <tt>make</tt> in the newly created <tt>webserver</tt>
  directory.</p>

<pre>cd ~/ece344
tar -xf /cad2/ece344f/src/webserver.tar
git status # should say that "webserver/" directory is untracked
git add webserver
git commit -m "Initial code for Lab 4"
git tag Lab4-start
cd webserver
make
</pre>

<p>The make command will create four executables
  called <tt>server</tt>, <tt>client_simple</tt>, <tt>client</tt>
  and <tt>fileset</tt>. We will describe the <tt>server</tt> program here, and
  then describe the other three programs later.</p>

<p>The <tt>server</tt> program we have provided you is a basic, single-threaded
  server. When you run it, you need to specify the port number that it will
  listen on. You should specify port numbers that are greater than about 2000 to
  avoid active ports. When you then connect your web browser to this server,
  make sure that you specify this same port. For example, assume that you are
  running on <tt>ug205.eecg</tt> and use port number 2003. Copy your favorite
  HTML file, called <tt>favorite.html</tt> to the <tt>webserver</tt>
  directory. Then, you can view this file from a web browser (running on the
  same or a different machine), by using the
  url: <tt>ug205.eecg.toronto.edu:2003/favorite.html</tt>. Note that you will
  need to run the web browser on one of the lab machines.</p>

<p>We are providing you with a bare bones, minimal web server. For example, the
  web server does not handle any HTTP requests other than GET. Also, it does not
  support running CGI programs. This web server is also not very robust; for
  example, if a web client closes its connection to the server, it may crash. We
  do not expect you to fix these problems!</p>

<p>The helper functions are simply wrappers for system calls that check the
  error codes of the system calls and immediately terminate if an error
  occurs. One should <b>always check error codes!</b> However, many programmer
  don't like to do it because they believe that it makes their code less
  readable; the solution is to use these wrapper functions.</p> 

<h2 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded Web Server</h2> 

<p>The basic web server that we have provided has a single thread of
  control. Single-threaded web servers suffer from a fundamental performance
  problem in that only a single HTTP request can be serviced at a time. Thus,
  every other client that is accessing this web server must wait until the
  current HTTP request has finished. This is a problem for two reasons. First,
  if your server is running on a multi-core processor or a multi-processor
  machine, a single thread can only use a single processor core, under-utilizing
  the machine. Second, if the current HTTP request is for a file that is
  resident only on disk (i.e., it is not in memory), then the request will be
  delayed until the file can be fetched from disk, during which time all the
  cores will remain completely idle.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will address the limitations of the basic web server by
  making it multi-threaded. The simplest approach to building a multi-threaded
  server is to spawn a new thread for serving each new HTTP request. The OS will
  then schedule these threads according to its own policy. The advantage of
  creating these threads is that short requests will not need to wait for a long
  request to complete. Further, when one thread is blocked (i.e., waiting for
  disk I/O to finish to fetch the file) the other threads can continue to handle
  other requests. However, the drawback of the one-thread-per-request approach
  is that the web server pays the overhead of creating a new thread on every
  request.</p>

<p>Therefore, the generally preferred approach for designing a multi-threaded
  server is to create a <b>fixed-size pool</b> of worker threads when the web
  server is first started. With this pool-of-threads approach, each thread is
  blocked until there is an HTTP request for it to handle. Therefore, if there
  are more worker threads than active requests, then some of the threads will be
  blocked, waiting for new HTTP requests to arrive. If there are more requests
  than worker threads, then those requests will need to be buffered until there
  is a ready thread. In this lab, you will implement this web server design.</p>

<p>In your implementation, you must have a master thread that begins by
  creating a pool of worker threads, the number of which is specified on the
  command line. Your master thread is then responsible for accepting new HTTP
  connections over the network and placing the socket descriptor for this
  connection into a fixed-size request buffer. The number of elements in the
  buffer is also specified on the command line. Note that the web server we have
  provided uses a single thread that accepts a connection, and then immediately
  handles the connection by reading the request and sending the response. In
  your web server, this (master) thread should place the connection descriptor
  into the fixed-size buffer and return to accepting more connections, i.e., it
  should not read the request or perform any request processing.</p>

<p>Each worker thread wakes up when there is an HTTP request in the queue. Once
  the worker thread wakes, it processes an HTTP request by performing a read on
  the network descriptor, obtains the specified content by reading the file that
  is requested, and then returns the content to the client by writing to the
  descriptor. The worker thread then waits for another HTTP request.</p>

<p>When there are multiple HTTP requests available, the requests are handled in
  FIFO order. Hence, when a worker thread wakes up, it handles the first request
  (i.e., the oldest request) in the buffer. Note that the HTTP requests will not
  necessarily finish in FIFO order. The order in which the requests complete
  will depend upon how long it takes to process the request and also on how the
  OS schedules the active threads.</p>

<p>Note that the master thread and the worker threads are in a
  producer-consumer relationship and require that their accesses to the shared
  buffer be synchronized. Specifically, the master thread must block and wait if
  the buffer is full. A worker thread must wait if the buffer is empty.</p>

<h2 id="web-server">Running the Web Server</h2> 

<p>The web server we provide should be invoked as follows:</p>

<pre>  ./server port nr_threads max_requests max_cache_size
</pre>

<p>The command line arguments are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>port:</b> the port number that the web server should listen on.</li>
  
  <li><b>nr_threads:</b> the number of worker threads that should be created
    within the web server. This number must be non-negative (&gt;= 0). When it is
    zero (zero worker threads), the basic web server that we have provided is
    run. When it is positive, then your implementation should create worker
    threads.</li>

  <li><b>max_requests:</b> the number of request connections that can be
    accepted at one time. This parameter specifies the size of the fixed-size
    buffer, and it applies only for the multi-threaded web server. It must be a
    positive integer. Note that it is not an error for more or less threads to
    be created than the buffer size.</li>

  <li><b>max_cache_size:</b> we will use this parameter in the next lab. For the
    moment, you can run the server with a value of 0 for this parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can run the initial web server that we have provided on port 5003 as
  follows:</p>

<pre>  ./server 5003 0 0 0
</pre>

<p>After you have implemented the multi-threaded web server, you could run your
  server as follows:</p>

<pre>  ./server 5003 8 16 0
</pre>

<p>Then your server should create 8 worker threads for handling HTTP requests,
  and allocate 16 buffers so that up to a maximum of 16 connections can be
  waiting to be served. Note that a request that is being served by a worker
  thread should no longer be in the request queue.
</p>

<h2 id="client">Running the Client</h2> 

<p>We have provided a simple browser client program
  called <tt>client_simple</tt>. Go ahead and use it as follows:</p>

<pre>  ./client_simple www.ece.toronto.edu 80 /index.html
</pre>

<p>The client simple program will allow you to fetch a single file from any web
  server. If you wish to use it for your own web server, you can use it as
  follows:</p>

<pre>  ./client_simple localhost 5003 /favorite.html
</pre>

<p>Here <tt>client_simple</tt> is run on the same machine as your server and
  hence it contacts the <tt>localhost</tt> machine. The port on which your
  server is assumed to be listening is 5003. The <tt>favorite.html</tt> file
  should lie in the <tt>webserver</tt> directory.</p>

<p>The <tt>client_simple</tt> program can be used test your web server. But it
  is hard to measure the performance of your web server with this simple
  program. Instead, we have provided you the <tt>client</tt> program for stress
  testing your web server. To run the
  <tt>client</tt> program, you will first need to generate a set of files that
  will be requested from the server. To do so, run the following command:</p>

<pre>  ./fileset
</pre>

<p>The <tt>fileset</tt> program generates a set of files in a directory. By
  default, it generates 256 files in the <tt>fileset_dir</tt> directory. The
  mean size for each file is 3 blocks, or 12 KB. It also generates an index file
  called <tt>fileset_dir.idx</tt>. This index file lists the total number of 
  files in the file set in the first line. After that, it lists one file per
  line. For each file, it lists the name of the file, a simple checksum for the
  file, and the size of the file. You can find out the parameters of the
  <tt>fileset</tt> program by running <tt>fileset</tt> with the <tt>--help</tt>
  option.</p>

<pre>  ./fileset --help
</pre>

<p>The file sizes generated by the <tt>fileset</tt> program are distributed
  according to
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto
    distribution</a>, which is a
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a>
  distribution. For the <tt>fileset</tt> program, this means that while most
  files are relatively small and close to the mean file size, there will be some
  files with very large sizes. These file size distributions are often found in
  practice. For example, most of the files in a system will be small but a few
  files are very large (e.g., video files, virtual machine images, etc.).</p>

<p>After generating the fileset, you can run the <tt>client</tt> program as
  follows:</p>

<pre>  ./client [-t] host port nr_times nr_threads fileset_dir.idx
</pre>

<p>The <tt>host</tt> argument is the name of the host on which the server is
  running. The <tt>port</tt> argument should be the same as the port at which
  the web server is listening for connections. We have provided you a
  multi-threaded <tt>client</tt> program, that runs
  with <tt>nr_threads</tt>. Each thread runs a loop <tt>nr_times</tt>,
  requesting a random file from the file set, once per loop. So the total number
  of file requests made by the client is <tt>nr_times * nr_threads</tt>. To
  request one file, make both these arguments have the value of
  1. The <tt>fileset_dir.idx</tt> argument is the index file generated by
  the <tt>fileset</tt> program that provides the file set information.</p>

<p id="self-similar">The client requests files randomly using
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similar_process">self-similar</a>
  process. In our case, this means that the client requests files with a lower
  index value more often. In particular, the top 20% of the files in file set
  are requested 80% of the time. Again, this behavior is typical of real-world
  web servers (many more
  people <a href="http://fanpagelist.com/category/celebrities/">visit</a>
  Shakira's facebook page than your home page).</p>

<p>When the <tt>client</tt> program is run, it will output the contents of the
  files in the file set to the terminal. This will be a lot of output, and the
  output has (you guessed that) random printable ascii characters. You can avoid
  seeing this output by piping the output to <tt>/dev/null</tt> as follows:</p>

<pre>  ./client host port nr_times nr_threads fileset_dir.idx &gt; /dev/null
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the client's <tt>[-t]</tt> option, which does not
  print the file output. Instead, it outputs in a single line, the time it took
  to run the client. This will allow you to time the client run.</p>

<p>How do we know that the server is working correctly? The server generates the
  file size and the file checksum in the response header lines, as shown in an
  example header below:</p>

<pre>Header: HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Header: Server: OS Web Server
Header: Content-Type: text/plain
Header: Content-Length: 619
Header: Content-Csum: 49888
</pre>

<p>Recall the index file generated by the <tt>fileset</tt> program. This file
  also has the file length and checksum fields for each file. The client
  performs two types of checks. First, it checks that the length and the
  checksum fields in the index file match the values in the response header
  lines shown above. Second, it also checks that the file content that it
  receives (the response body) has the same correct length and checksum
  values. So if your web server is not working correctly, these checks will not
  pass, and your client will crash.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Solution Requirements</h2>

<p>You are required to use <b>condition variables</b> for synchronization. <b>If
  your implementation performs any busy-waiting (or spin-waiting), you will be
  heavily penalized.</b></p>

<p>The rest of the requirements are described earlier, when we described the
  <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ashvin/courses/ece344/current/lab4.html#multi-threaded">design of the multi-threaded web server</a>.</p>
  
<h2>Hints and Advice</h2> 

<p>We recommend understanding how the code that we gave you works. We provide
  the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>server.c:</b> Contains the main() function for the web server.</li>
  <li><b>server_thread.c:</b> Currently, this file contains the main routine for
    serving web requests. This routine, invoked by the main server thread in the
    basic web server, calls various functions in <tt>request.c</tt>, described
    below. <b>This is the only file that you should modify for this
    lab.</b></li>
  <li><b>request.c:</b> Performs most of the work for handling HTTP requests,
    including reading requests from a connection, and sending the response back.
    All procedures in this file begin with the string
    “request”.</li>
  <li><b>common.c:</b> Contains wrapper functions for the system calls invoked
    by the various programs.</li>
  <li><b>client.c:</b> Contains the main() function and the support routines for
    our stylized web client.</li>
  <li><b>client_simple.c:</b> Contains the main() function and the support
    routines for a simple web client that requests a single file.</li>
  <li><b>fileset.c:</b> Contains the code for generating the file set.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to learn about the code is to compile it and run it. Run the
  server we gave you with your preferred web browser or with
  the <tt>client_simple</tt> program that we have provided to you. Request a
  single file using the client code, and see the output of the server and the
  client. Make small changes to the server code (e.g., have it print out more
  debugging information) to see if you understand how it works.</p>

<p>We anticipate that you will find the following routines useful for creating
  and synchronizing
  threads: <tt>pthread_create</tt>, <tt>pthread_mutex_init</tt>,
  <tt>pthread_mutex_lock</tt>, <tt>pthread_mutex_unlock</tt>,
  <tt>pthread_cond_init</tt>, <tt>pthread_cond_wait</tt>, and
  <tt>pthread_cond_signal</tt>. To find information on these library routines,
  read their manuals on the web.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to reuse <i>your own</i> code that you might have
developed in the previous labs or in previous courses to handle things such as
queues, hashing, etc.</p>

<p>Feel free to consult the instructor's notes on the solutions to the
producer-consumer problem.</p>

<h2>Note on Security</h2>

<p>It is worthwhile to be a little careful with security during this
  project. The server program that we have provided does not serve files that
  have absolute paths, or a <b>..</b> in the file name. Both would allow others
  to explore any files in your home directory to which you have access (and they
  normally don't). We also disallow serving “.c” and
  “.h” source files. Where are these checks implemented? Even so, it
  will be a good idea to avoid running your server for a long time.</p>

<h2>Testing Your Code</h2>

<p>To help you test your code better, we have provided several
  scripts, as described below.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>run-one-experiment:</b></dt>
  <dd>This script runs the <tt>server</tt> program, and then it runs
    the <tt>client</tt> program 10 times, and provides the average run time of
    the client. All the client run times are recorded in the <tt>run.out</tt>
    file. Read the beginning of this file to see how it should be invoked. This
    script can take up to 3 minutes to run.</dd>
  
  <dt><b>run-experiment:</b></dt>
  <dd>This script runs the <tt>run-one-experiment</tt> script while varying
    various server parameters. Read the beginning of this file to see how it
    should be invoked. For this lab, you should invoke it with the
    “nocache” argument. In this case, the script will generate two
    output files, <tt>plot-threads.out</tt>
    and <tt>plot-requests.out</tt>. These files contain the client run times
    when the number of threads and outstanding requests are varied for the
    server. This script can take 20-30 minutes to run, so use it when you are
    close to finishing the lab.</dd>

  <dt><b>plot-experiment:</b></dt>
  <dd>This script plots the output files generated
    by <tt>run-experiment</tt>. The plots are available
    in <tt>plot-threads.pdf</tt> and <tt>plot-requests.pdf</tt>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can test your entire code by using our auto-tester program at any time by
  following the <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ashvin/courses/ece344/current/testing.html">testing instructions.</a> For this
  assignment, the auto-tester program simply runs the <tt>run-experiment</tt>
  and the <tt>plot-experiment</tt> scripts.</p>

<!--

<h2>Performance Results</h2>

<p>The <tt>run-experiment</tt> script allows you to evaluate the performance of
  your web server. For this lab, we ask that you write a document in a new text
  file, called <tt>evaluation.txt</tt>, that describes your web server
  performance results.</p>

<p>Your document should describe what you expect the server performance to be as
  you vary the server parameters, and whether your plots meet these
  expectations. If the plots don't meet these expectations, you should provide a
  reasonable justification. Do not write more than 30-40 lines of text, each
  line at most 80 characters wide.</p>

<p>For this lab, we will be evaluating your submission using our automated
  marker as well as your performance write up. <b>We will allocate 25% of the
    lab marks for the write up.</b></p>
-->

<h2 id="using-git">Using Git</h2>

<p>You should only modify the following files in this lab.</p>

<pre>  server_thread.c
</pre>

<!--
<p>The <tt>evaluation.txt</tt> file is a new file that you will create to
  described your performance results. It should be located in
  the <tt>webserver</tt> directory.</p>
-->

<p>You can find the files you have modified by running the <tt>git status</tt>
command.</p>

<p>You can commit your modified files to your local repository as follows:</p>

<pre>  git add server_thread.c
  git commit -m "Committing changes for Lab 4"
</pre>

<p>We suggest committing your changes frequently by rerunning the commands above
(with different meaningful messages to the commit command), so that you can go
back to see the changes you have made over time, if needed.</p>

<p>Once you have tested your code, <b>and committed it</b> (check that by
running <tt>git status</tt>), you can tag the assignment as done.</p>

<pre>git tag Lab4-end
</pre>

<p>This tag names the last commit, and you can see that using the <tt>git
log</tt> or the <tt>git show</tt> commands.</p>

<p>If you want to see all the changes you have made in this lab, you can run the
following <tt>git diff</tt> command.</p>

<pre>git diff Lab4-start Lab4-end
</pre>

<p>More information for using the various git commands is available in
the <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~ashvin/courses/ece344/current/lab1.html#using-git">Lab 1 instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Code Submission</h2>

<p>Make sure to add the <tt>Lab4-end</tt> tag to your local repository as
described above. Then run the following command to update your remote
repository:</p>

<pre>git push --tags
